This project is about my analysis of the well-known [Fisher's Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) dataset and the variables in contains. The Iris data set is one of the nmost well-known and commonly used datasets in the field of statistics and machine learning. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Ronald Fisher, a British biologist and statistician, introduced this concept in 1936.

The project focuses on Iris data set and a [copy of the iris data set csv file](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) was downloaded used to do the analysis. 

Attribute Information:
1. Sepal length in cm
2. Sepal width in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal width in cm
5. Variety/Species:
    - Iris Setosa
    - Iris Versicolor
    - Iris Virginica


## Use of This Project

This project is useful for getting started with Data Analytics and importantly to demonstrate the following:
- Source and investigate sets of data.
- Programmatically explore and visualize data.
- Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
- Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
- Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
- Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.
