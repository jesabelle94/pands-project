## About This Project

This project is about my analysis of the well-known [Fisher's Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) dataset and the variables in contains. The Iris data set is one of the earliest datasets used for teaching, learning purposes on classification methonds and used in statistics and machine learning. It contains information about 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

- Programmatically explore and visualize data.
- Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
- Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
- Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
- Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.
